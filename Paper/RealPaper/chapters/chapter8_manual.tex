\par When being on the Main page, seen at image\ref{fig:MainPageLooks}, starting the recording is as simple as pressing the "Start recording" button. After 1 or 2 seconds, the recording start, which can be seen when the black square changes to the live camera feed, like in image\ref{fig:MainPageRecordingLooks}.

\par While the video is being recorded, the visual part is saved in real-time to the folder selected in the settings, named as TempRecording, as seen in image\ref{fig:TempRecordingLooks}. This file is not the whole video, the audio part is merged with the visual when the recording stops, and opening it until it is finished is not advised, since the behaviour of the application in that case is unknown.
