\section{Machine Learning Model Improvements}
\label{sec:futuresec1}

\par The current model performs quite well in the ideal conditions stated in chapter \ref{chap:model}. Most of the shortcomings in other situations stem from the training data. In order to improve upon the model the dataset should be improved with approximately thousand of images, with different image conditions, including lighting, background distance and different obstacles, which takes some time, but is the next improvement step of the application.

\section{GPU Utilization}
\label{sec:futuresec2}

\par The tensorflow framework has built-in gpu utilization, however setting it up is independent of the application, because of the CUDA drivers. Another improvement is to try and achieve GPU utilization automatically, and looking into other types of GPU tools, since the current version only supports NVIDIA made graphics cards, which can run the 11.2 version of CUDA.
